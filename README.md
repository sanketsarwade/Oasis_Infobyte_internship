# Oasis Infobyte Internship Repository

Welcome to the Oasis Infobyte Internship Repository! This repository showcases the data science projects completed during my internship at Oasis Infobyte. The projects included car price prediction, iris flower classification, and unemployment rate prediction.

## Project Descriptions

### Car Price Prediction
In this project, I developed a model to predict car prices based on various features and attributes. I employed regression algorithms such as Linear Regression, Decision Tree Regression, Random Forest Regression, and more. The performance of each model was evaluated using metrics like mean absolute error and accuracy.

### Iris Flower Classification
In this project, I built a classification model to classify different species of iris flowers based on petal and sepal measurements. Classification algorithms such as Logistic Regression, Decision Tree, and SVM were utilized. The performance of each model was assessed using metrics like accuracy, precision, and recall.

### Unemployment Rate Prediction
In this project, I developed a model to predict the unemployment rate based on relevant economic indicators and historical data. Regression algorithms such as ARD Regression, MLP Regression, and XGBoost Regression were employed. Evaluation metrics such as mean squared error and R-squared score were used to assess the model's performance.

## Getting Started

To get started with any of the projects, follow the instructions provided in their respective project folders. You will find information on dependencies, data preprocessing, model training, and evaluation.

## Dependencies

The projects were developed using Python and the following libraries: pandas, scikit-learn, matplotlib, xgboost. Make sure you have these dependencies installed before running the code.
